# 🕹️ irmin-toy

_A simplified clone of the Irmin distributed database._


## About

This library is meant as a development tool for [Irmin](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/),
a distributed database library.

It provides roughly the same abstractions as Irmin with a simplified codebase, which should
allow quicker iteration times when working on proofs-of-concept for new Irmin features.
